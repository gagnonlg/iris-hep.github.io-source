project_title: Efficient implementation of tracking algorithms for ATLAS in ACTS
project_goal: >
  Charged particle track reconstruction is the most time-consuming part of the ATLAS reconstruction software, and the upcomming luminosity upgrade of the LHC (HL-LHC) necessitates new and improved tracking algorithms that can cope with the increased data rates. This project aims to improve existing algorithms and implement new, cutting edge techniques including machine learning models and GPU-accelerated algorithms within the ACTS framework.
